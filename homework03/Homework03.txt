 Private Access is an access mechanism that restricts access to the class method and variables to the class only. Outside of the class, they can't be accessed or affected. As a result, the class elements are now shielded from the outer world. This is in line with encapsulation, which states that we construct a set of properties and bind them together within a single unit with no external effect. As a result, private access preserves encapsulation. Private access is helpful where a higher degree of protection is needed and we do not want any outside interference. Protected access is identical to private access, except that the assets can be passed down to the base class. As a result, in the case of succession, there is an outside impact on the covered persons. It is helpful in all situations where we don't want external control, except in a few special cases where we need external influence that isn't possible by private access.
